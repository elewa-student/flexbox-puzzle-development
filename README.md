This will be a puzzle where developers learning Flexbox can practice their FlexBox skills.  They will be presented with a scrambled image and will be expected to unscramble it using FlexBox CSS properties.

## User Stories


A user can ...
* Solve the puzzle with CSS
* See the class & id for each image fragment
* See original 
* See un-shuffled image
* Undo back to original shuffle (delete your css)
* See image at all times
* Apply their CSS with a button
* Choose a new puzzle (multiple shufflings)
* Choose a different level 
* (ranked difficulty of multiple shufflings)
* Get a friendly message when they win
* Get hints when they ask

## Story Dependencies

Make a dependency chart for your user stories on Sketchboard.io and push it to this repository.

![](./<your chart name>.png)

This chart will organize your user stories into a [tree](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-tree-data-structures-bceacb85490c) where any child cannot be developed before it's parent.  ie. "User can save data" would be a parent of "User can retrieve data".

Doing this can be tricky at first but with practice will give you an incredibly powerful way to think about the development process.

## Development Schedule

Write a list from 0 (set up project) to N (final step).

This list is built by referring to the chart you made above.  You can put your user stories in any order as long as you respect the parent/child relationships illustrated in the tree.

To use this list correctly you can't just plow through the list.  After finishing each story, pause and test the application:  Does the new story work? Do the old ones still work?  Your goal is to add _non-breaking_ features to your site, one at a time and in a logical order.

Each time you finish a feature, mark the commit with a [Version Release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/).  This will allow you to easily check out previous versions of the website.

This skills is central to the Agile methodology.  Practice it now while you're still building basic web pages, it will be hard to learn when you're in the middle of a deployment.
